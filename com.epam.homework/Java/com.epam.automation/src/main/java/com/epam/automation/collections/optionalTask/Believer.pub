You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
(Pain)
My life, my love, my drive, it came from
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
(Pain)
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer
(Pain, pain)
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
It rained down, like
'Til it broke up and it rained down
Inhibited, limited
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
The blood in my veins, oh ooh
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
By the grace of the fire and the flames
Last things last
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
(Pain)
My life, my love, my drive, it came from
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
(Pain)
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer
(Pain, pain)
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
It rained down, like
'Til it broke up and it rained down
Inhibited, limited
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
Falling like ashes to the ground
Building my rain up in the cloud
I was choking in the crowd
Your spirit up above, oh ooh
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Send a prayer to the ones up above
Third things third
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
(Pain)
My life, my love, my drive, it came from
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
(Pain)
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
(Pain, pain)
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Seeing the beauty through the
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Taking my message from the veins
Singing from heartache from the pain
That looked at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Write down my poems for the few
Taking my sulking to the masses
I was broken from a young age
The master of my sea, oh ooh
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be
Second thing second
The way that things have been, oh ooh
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
I'ma say all the words inside my head
First things first
